SQL> alter system set db_recovery_file_dest_size = 10G;
SQL> alter system set db_recovery_file_dest = ' Any location in your os';

SQL> SHOW PARAMETER RECOVERY;  --verify that the new dest and size is set.


2-V : When its time to restore your controlfile from backup, if the method specified
      in lab document does not work, try this :
RMAN> RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;
